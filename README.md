The python sample is from an NFC tag product management platform. As tags were
scanned the platform would record the lat/lon of the scan. The python code would
summarize the scans by customer, and add city/state information, allowing the
customer to see how many of their products were scanned by city.


The react sample is a teams section of a sports website I made that uses javascript
and react for both front end and back end. The database I use is firebase, and the
javascript talks to firebase to get player names, descriptions and images. I display
the data using html.
